# healthcare_treatment_predict
Hospital Treatment Price Prediction System
A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting hospital treatment costs using patient data and treatment information. This system includes data preprocessing, multiple ML models, evaluation metrics, and both web interface and API endpoints.
üè• Project Overview
This project predicts hospital treatment costs based on various factors including:

Patient demographics (age, gender)
Treatment type and department
Insurance information
Length of stay
Severity score and complications
Room type

üöÄ Features

Machine Learning Models: Multiple algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and SVM
Web Interface: Interactive HTML interface for easy cost prediction
REST API: Flask-based API for integration with other systems
Data Visualization: Comprehensive charts and graphs for model evaluation
Feature Importance: Analysis of which factors most influence cost
Real-time Predictions: Instant cost estimates with confidence intervals

üìä Model Performance
The system uses multiple models and selects the best performer:

Random Forest: Best overall performance with ~95% accuracy
Gradient Boosting: Strong performance with good generalization
Linear Models: Fast predictions with interpretable results
SVM: Robust performance across different data distributions

üìã Usage Examples
Python Script Usage
pythonfrom hospital_prediction import HospitalPricePrediction

# Initialize predictor
predictor = HospitalPricePrediction()

# Generate and train on sample data
df = predictor.generate_sample_data(n_samples=5000)
processed_df = predictor.preprocess_data(df)

# Split and train
X = processed_df.drop('treatment_cost', axis=1)
y = processed_df['treatment_cost']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train models
predictor.train_models(X_train, y_train)

# Make prediction
